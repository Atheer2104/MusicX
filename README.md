# MusicX
I was assaigned to create a project of what I want, so i came up with this idea an app where 
you search for music lycrics (the lycrics are provided from genius) and then play the music on youtube if you want. 
Because I want to learn SwiftUI, I decided that this project will be built with it.




<b> Goals </b> 
 * shall work on diffirent kind of ios screens
 * easy to read code and add additional features 
 * be able to search for a lyric on get back response with the genius api
 * be able to play that song via youtube 
 * supports darkmode 
 * use core data to save a favorites songs and use spotify api to get popular music 
 
 <h4> Here is the current design of the app <a href="https://app.moqups.com/bou3VM1FEo/view">click here</a></h4>


<h1>Progress</h1>
Currently the project is going good, I have worked on search view and lyrics view next stage is to work on the music player. To conclude here are some screenshots of the app. 
<b>PS: The app is not done and there is a lot of little tweaks/feature that are missing. I belive making the main and crucial parts work are far more important in this stage. </b>
