# MusicX
I was assaigned to create a project of what I want, so i came up with this idea an app where 
you search for music lycrics (the lycrics are provided from genius) and then play the music on youtube if you want. 
Because I want to learn SwiftUI, I decided that this project will be built with it.

<h1>Progress</h1>
I'm considering the project done, I have achieved the goals that I set. I Have learned much about SwiftUI and some personal thoughts SwiftUI is doing was is supposed to do it is easy to create simple and complex views however is lacks more basic components like the wkwebview. In all, it feels that I had to take the longer and unnecessary road to implement some stuff. Though i didn't implement a popular view because it would be very difficult using Spotify API and make it compatible with genius API, but could get popular songs from genius but feel that wasn't necessary and I want to move on to the next projectct. 

<h2>Time</h2>
I did also take note of how much time I spent on this project and total it took about 61 hours and that is from an idea to an app. I'm including the time spent on the design too, don't know if this information could be useful for any of you but in case someone is wondering. 


<h3> Goals </h3>

 * shall work on diffirent kind of ios screens
 * easy to read code and add additional features 
 * be able to search for a lyric on get back response with the genius api
 * be able to play that song via youtube 
 * supports darkmode 
 * use core data to save a favorites songs and use spotify api to get popular music
